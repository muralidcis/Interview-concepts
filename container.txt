Container orchestrations:

managing life cycle of containers. 
and what is a container, 

Cluster: compute machines or nodes,
Controlpanel: collection of processes that cotrols nodes,taks,assignment
kubelet: resive runs on the node and reads the container mainfests,start and stop
pod : group or more then one containers deployed to a single node. pod,ipaddress,hostname and othr resource.

orscastera
YAML or json-> configurations
path of container image, how to establish and store logs

Container managment will automaticlly shcedule the cluster to host.

lifecycle,scale of container,

kubernetces,docker swarm
________________________

container are deployed onto hosts, scheduler, look for cup memory,metadatainfo.
once hosted, life cycle


What is redshift
-----------------
collection of computing resource called nodes. group of nodes makes a cluster.dataware house, data and scale to a petabyte.
These all runs on database engine,
creating clusters
snapshot ->s3->ssl
cluster acess and security
aws iam,identy and acess managment
security group,


Lamda:
it lets you to run your code,without a serverless, for automatision,scaling.

image->awsimage->loaded to s3 bucket->lambda will trigger->lambda will run the image resize code->perofmrs the output.

stream process:
kinsis:
steam is loaded->lambada will trigger->lambda runs the code->dynamodb->abalibale for busine querary

dynamodb:
key-value based document database.
memory cachching,
multi-master
sychoronised replication across inmultip datacenter
its a schema less, and table and primary key






cluster:
perform data analysis query
